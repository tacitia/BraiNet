    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>To evaluate the effectiveness of the goal-offloading mechanisms described in this paper, we conducted a within subject study to compare the goal-offloading interface with a base interface that provides the same functionality but has no visual cues to help the user keep of his or her goals. During the study, the participants are asked to explore rat brain connectivity using the given applications. To make it resemble a real-world scenario where the user might be interrupted by external distractions while working, we have designed a secondary task where the participants are asked to respond to pop-up messages while working on the main tasks.</p>
    <h4>Participants</h4>
    <p>We recruited 30 participants in total, all of which are Brown students. Out of the 30 participants, 20 are grad students and 10 are undergrad students. There are 16 female participants and 14 male participants. Participants have various academic background, including Computer Science, Neuroscience, ..... Two participants are left-handed while the remaining are all right-handed ([Is this necessary to report?]). Ten participants are from neuroscience or cognitive science and are familiar with brain anatomy. Eight participants have seen a circular visualization before.</p>
    <h4>Tasks</h4>
    <h5>Main Task</h5>
    <p>The main task is a brain connection search and evaluation task. The participants are asked to find all the paths that involve one intermediate node between two given brain regions, evaluate the paths according to a set of given criteria, and report the intermediate node that he or she believes to be the most probable one that is responsible for the functional association between the two given brain regions. The task is designed to closely resemble what an expert user would use the application for, except that while an expert user will likely to we ask the participants to form their belief on a condensed set of information about each connection.</p>
    <h5>Secondary Task</h5>
    <p>The secondary task is designed to resemble the task of replying an email. While the user is working on the main tasks, a message will pop up from time to time and the user will have to respond to the message first before he could continue with the main task. Each message contains a question about living and studying at Brown, asked by an imaginary incoming Brown student. There is no prior notice for the participant before a message pops up. Each participant will complete 4 secondary tasks during each session. It takes about 2 - 3 minutes for a participant to complete a secondary task.</p>
    <h4>Measurements</h4>
    <p>We measured and analyzed the following variables during the study:<br/>1) Task completion time: the time it takes for a participant to complete a single task.<br/>2) Interruption recovery time: the time it takes for a participant to  <br/>
3) </p>
