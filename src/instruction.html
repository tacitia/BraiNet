        <h3 class="center">Brain Circuits Visualization User Study Instruction</h3>
        <p>In this study, you will explore rat brain connectivity using the given application. There will be two tasks, where each will take approximately 30 minutes. In each task, you will be asked to find all the paths that involve one intermediate region between two given brain regions, evaluate the paths according to a set of criteria described below, and report the intermediate region that you believe to be the most probable one that is responsible for the functional association between the two given brain regions.</p>
        <p>While you are working on the two tasks, you will also need to complete some short secondary tasks. Each secondary task will involve reading and answering a message that pops up when you are working on the main tasks. Each message will contain a question about living in Brown and Providence, asked by an incoming Brown student. The messages may pop up any time while you are working on the two tasks. You will encounter approximately 4 - 5 messages during the study.</p>
        <h4>Guidelines for choosing the most probable intermediate regions</h4>
        <h5>Connection evaluation criteria</h5>
        <p>We ask you to consider the following factors when evaluating each connection:<br/>
            1. Number of distinct references associated with each connection. Higher number of distinct references implies that the connection is more likely to exist.<br/>
            2. Citation count for each of the associated literature. You do not need to read the paper, but you need to check the number of citations of each paper using Google Scholar and take that into account. Higher citation count implies higher credibility of the paper.<br/>
            3. Diversity of techniques. If a connection is associated with records that have used different techniques, it should be considered stronger when compared to a connection associated with only one type of technique, given everything else being equal.<br/>
            4. The strength of the connection reported by the associated literature. The strength can be either "weak", "moderate" or "heavy".<br/>
            The above information will be available when you click on a connection in the visualization.
        <h5>Regions v.s. groups of cells</h5>
        <p>In the search result, you will see two types of intermediate nodes: regions and groups of cells. Regions are colored in dark brown and cells are colored in light brown (see the illustration below.</p>
        <img src="media/img/instruction2.png" class="center" style="width:1000px; height:auto"></img>
        <p><b>For the two tasks, you will need to report a region, not a group of cells.</b> However, each region consists of several groups of cells, so when you are evaluating each intermediate region, you should consider all the relevant connections that involve any group of cells that belong to that region. Connections are transferable: <b>a connection between two groups of cells can also be interpretated as a connection between the brain regions that contain those two groups of cells respectively.</b></p>
        <p>In the visualization, the layers of arcs represent the hierarchy, where the parent-children relationship between a brain region and a group of cells is indicated by finer division of angles.</p>
        <h4>How to use the application</h4>
        <img src="media/img/instruction1.png" class="center" style="width:1000px; height:auto"></img>
        <p>Note: the input panel allows you to read legends, customize the visualization, search the dataset and see help information. <b>For the purpose of the study, you will only need to make use of the Search tab.</b></p>
        <h4>Tasks</h4>
        <p>
            1. Report the most probable path that accounts for the communication between hippocampal region and anterior hypothalamic area. <br/>
            2. Report the most probable path that accounts for the communication between striatam and dorsal thalamus.<p>
