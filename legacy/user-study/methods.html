    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>To evaluate the effectiveness of the goal-offloading mechanisms described in this paper, we conducted a within subject study to compare the goal-offloading interface with a baseline interface that provides the same functionality but has no visual cues to help the user keep track of his or her goals. During the study, the participants are asked to collect certain information about the connectivity between two given rat brain regions using the given applications. To make it resemble a real-world scenario where the user might be interrupted by external distractions while working, we have designed a secondary task where the participants are asked to respond to pop-up messages while working on the main tasks.</p>
    <h4>Participants</h4>
    <p>We recruited 30 participants in total, all of which are Brown students. Out of the 30 participants, 20 are grad students and 10 are undergrad students. There are 16 female participants and 14 male participants. Participants have various academic background, including Computer Science, Neuroscience, ..... Two participants are left-handed while the remaining are all right-handed ([Is this necessary to report?]). Ten participants are from neuroscience or cognitive science and are familiar with brain anatomy. Eight participants have seen a circular visualization before.</p>
    <h4>Tasks</h4>
    <h5>Main Task</h5>
    <p>For the main task, we ask the participant to collect several pieces of information about the paths connecting two given brain regions using the application, Google Scholar and Word/Excel. The participants are given the names of two brain regions for each task, and they need to type in the two names in the application and click a search button to see all the paths connecting the two given brain regions that involve one and only one intermediate brain region. The participant then needs to gather the following information for each of the intermediate brain region: 1) number of sub-connections (a sub-connection between region A and region B is defined as a connection between a sub-region of A and a sub-region of B) between the source region and the intermediate region; 2) number of sub-connections between the intermediate region and the target region; 3) number of different techniques used to examine each sub-connection; 4) number of distinct pieces of literature associate with each sub-connection; 5) citation counts for each relevant piece of literature. They are instructed to obtain the citation count using Google Scholar and record the information gathered using either Word or Excel.</p>
    <p>The task is designed to resemble a task described by an expert user that we have interviewed, except that while an expert user will likely to read the literature associated with each connection in detail and choose one intermediate brain region for further experiment, we only ask the participants to perform the information collection part of the task as the final judgement requires expertise in neuroscience.</p>
    <p>There were four tasks in total for each participant, and we asked the participants to complete two tasks using the goal-offloading interface and the other two using the baseline interface. To account for the potential ordering effect, half of the participants worked with the baseline interface first and then the goal-offloading interface while the other half did the study the other way around.</p>
    <h5>Secondary Task</h5>
    <p>The secondary task is designed to resemble the task of replying an email. While the user is working on the main tasks, a message will pop up from time to time and the user will have to respond to the message first before he could continue with the main task. Each message contains a question about living and studying at Brown, asked by an imaginary incoming Brown student. There is no prior notice for the participant before a message pops up. Each participant will complete 4 secondary tasks during each session. It takes about 2 - 3 minutes for a participant to complete a secondary task.</p>
    <h4>Measurements</h4>
    <p>We measured and analyzed the following variables during the study:<br/>1) Task completion time: the time it takes for a participant to complete a single task.<br/>2) Task switching recovery time: the elapsed time between the user returning to the application after using an external tool (i.e., Google Scholar or Word/Excel) and starting moving on to the next step.<br/>3) Interruption recovery time: the elapsed time between the completion of a secondary task and the continuation of the main task.<br/>4) Evidence loss rate: The percentage of connection information missed by a participant.<br>5) User's subjective cognitive load for finishing the main task.</p>
