Brain Connectivity Explorer, as the name suggests, is a web-based tool that allows one to explore brain connectivity visualized as network graphs. Click here to access the tool. A quick video tutorial is available here.

Currently, the visualization is populated using a pre-loaded dataset derived based on connectivity data from Brain Architecture Management System. In the future, we plan to provide more pre-loaded datasets, especially those indexed by Neuroscience Information Framework. We will also work towards supporting user-uploaded datasets that conform to a standard format.

Currently, the visualization only shows connections that are reported to exist. It is not possible to distinguish between connections that are reported to be non-existent and connections that have no associated information yet. We plan to add a zoomable matrix visualization in the next iteration to address this problem.
